abstract="Phenology is the study of recurring biological events and its relationship to climate. Circular statistics is an area of statistics not very much used by ecologists nor by other researchers from the biological sciences, and indeed not much visited, till recently in statistical science. Nevertheless, the connection between the evaluation of temporal, recurring events and the analysis of directional data have converged in several papers, and show circular statistics to be an outstanding tool by which to better understand plant phenology. The aim of this chapter is to assess applications for circular statistics in plant phenology and its potential for phenological data analysis in general. We do not discuss the mathematics of circular statistics, but discuss its actual and potential applications to plant phenology. We provide several examples at various levels of application: from generating circular phenological variables to the actual testing of hypotheses, say, for the existence of certain a priori seasonal patterns. Circular statistics has particular value and application when flowering onset (or fruiting) occurs almost continuously in an annual cycle and importantly in southern climates, where flowering time may not have a logical starting point, such as mid-winter dormancy. We conclude circular statistics applies well to phenological research where we want to test for relationships between flowering time and other phenological traits (e.g. shoot growth), or with functional traits such as plant height. It also allows us to group species into annual, supra-annual, irregular and continuous reproducers; to study seasonality in reproduction and growth; and to assess synchronization of species.",

abstract = {Summary Activity level (the proportion of time that animals spend active) is a behavioural and ecological metric that can provide an indicator of energetics, foraging effort and exposure to risk. However, activity level is poorly known for free-living animals because it is difficult to quantify activity in the field in a consistent, cost-effective and non-invasive way. This article presents a new method to estimate activity level with time-of-detection data from camera traps (or more generally any remote sensors), fitting a flexible circular distribution to these data to describe the underlying activity schedule, and calculating overall proportion of time active from this. Using simulations and a case study for a range of small- to medium-sized mammal species, we find that activity level can reliably be estimated using the new method. The method depends on the key assumption that all individuals in the sampled population are active at the peak of the daily activity cycle. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that this assumption is likely to be met for many species, but may be less likely met in large predators, or in high-latitude winters. Further research is needed to establish stronger evidence on the validity of this assumption in specific cases; however, the approach has the potential to provide an effective, non-invasive alternative to existing methods for quantifying population activity levels.},
